# Just-Ask

## Problem

Nowadays, students are unable to convey their doubts and hesitate to ask questions to the teacher.
There are various reasons to answer the question of why students are reluctant to ask doubts. For ex. fear of peers, shyness, etc.
This leads to students suffering from various problems like lack of understanding and clarity of the topics, etc.
Also, lack of interaction between students and teachers makes the teachers more frustrated and results in degradation of the classroom environment.

## Our solution

To solve the above problems, we have a proposed app that aims at increasing classroom interaction and also make it fun and interesting.
The app will have an interface that will allow the teacher to put up a prompt, which will be made available to all the students for a stipulated time.
This prompt is an option for the students to ask their doubts or questions according to their own will. With their identity hidden, students won’t hesitate to ask questions.
To ensure proper discipline is maintained, we have included a moderator that will ensure that students don't write any inappropriate words.
In this way, we aim to overcome the fear in students of not asking questions and also maintain a proper flow of class teachings as well as inculcate proper knowledge among all the students.
This idea can be implemented in schools and colleges as well as in workshops, webinars and other live events.
